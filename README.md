More about the project's implementation:

During my participation in the software systems development methods course, I collaborated with a team of five individuals on the EKrut Project. This experience allowed us to gain valuable insights into server-side and client-side technologies. For our project, we chose Java as the programming language due to its reliability and scalability in the software development domain.

To create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface, we leveraged JavaFX and SceneBuilder. These tools enabled us to efficiently design the graphical user interface (GUI). On the server-side, we employed the Object-oriented Client-Server Framework (OCSF) method for smooth communication between clients and the server. Additionally, we established a connection between the server and a MySQL database to store and retrieve data efficiently.

The client-side of the application was developed using Java to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience. A vital component of our implementation was the ServerMessage class, which facilitated communication between the client and server. This class efficiently routed commands using an Enum and switch case statement, ensuring precise query handling and appropriate responses.

Overall, our collaborative effort on the EKrut Project showcased our ability to work as a team and build a complex software application using multiple technologies. By incorporating Java, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder, we created an appealing and user-friendly interface. Our utilization of OCSF and MySQL established a reliable and efficient client-server architecture. Through this project, we demonstrated our skills and expertise in software development while nurturing our passion for learning and growth in the field.
